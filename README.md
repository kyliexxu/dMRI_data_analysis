# dMRI_data_analysis
## Week 2
This week, we visited the [Saint Justine Hospital](https://www.chusj.org/) and met our mentor in person.
This week, our principal task was to code via Python to:

 - Process the data
 - Clean the data
 - Classify the data

Here are some highlights of our code!

	plt.title('Birth Weight of Babies')

	plt.xlabel('Birth age (weeks)')
	
	plt.ylabel('Birth weight(kg)')

We explored histone, bar and scatter plots. Through our codes, we learned the concepts of libraries, variables and functions in python. We also learn a few new tricks to make our graphs more informative and professional. For example, the addition of a best-fit line, the addition of a legend and the addition of error bars really helped us improve our graphs and improve our knowledge of the language.

## MRI safety
This week, we learned about the importance of metal-free objects in an MRI room. Because of the powerful magnetic force encapsuling the MRI room, everybody entering the room needs to be scanned through in order to ensure that no ferromagnetic objects will be in contact with the machine. The heavier the object, the fastest it will rotate in the machine and the stronger the attraction will be. 
[The videos we watched](https://youtu.be/LS2hwW6Ihj4) goes in full detail on the safety mesures and precautious we need to follow.
